## AI Image Metadata Checker

A CLI Python script that can scan local image files for common AI-generated metadata indicators (ex: OPENAI, DALLE, Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity).

This tool helps identify whether an image has been processed or generated by AI tools by checking embedded metadata for common AI "tags".

It scans for known binary metadata identifiers like:
- `DALLÂ·E`
- `c2pa`
- `claim_generator`
- `created_software_agent`
- and more...

---------------------------
## How Python Logic Works

The script opens an image file in binary mode and checks for specific AI-related metadata tags. If any are found, it prints them out in a human-readable format.
